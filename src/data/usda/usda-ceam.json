The flower petals are dipper-shaped, 1-1.5\nmm long, and white colored.\nDistribution: For current distribution, please consult\nthe Plant Profile page for this species on the\nPLANTS Web site.\nHabitat: New Jersey tea is usually found in the sandy\nsoils of open woodlands and prairies, and on rocky\nhillsides.\nAdaptation\nNew Jersey tea is fire-adapted. It is typically top-\nkilled by fire, but is a prolific re-sprouter from the\nsurviving rootstock. Where frequent fire occurs,\nNew Jersey tea becomes a dominant species forming\nclusters among prairie grasses.\nEstablishment\nNew Jersey tea is a drought tolerant species that\ngrows best in well-drained soils with full sun. New\nJersey tea is difficult to transplant, therefore\npropagation by seed is recommended. Seeds should\nbe planted outside in the late fall or early winter. To\nimprove seed germination for spring planting the\nseeds should be submerged in hot water (180 deg. F)\n@ PLANTS\nand allowed to soak overnight as the water cools then\nplanted outside.\nUses\nEthnobotanic: Tribes of the Missouri River region Pests and Potential Problems\nused the leaves for tea and burned the roots for fuel New Jersey tea is susceptible to leaf spot and\non buffalo hunting trips when fuel wood was scarce. powdery mildew, however no serious insect or\nThe roots of New Jersey tea were used by the disease problems exist.\nChippewa for pulmonary troubles and for\nconstipation coupled with shortness of breath and Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and\nbloa",
