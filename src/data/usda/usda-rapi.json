Yellow\nconeflower is a native perennial herb growing from a\nwoody caudex up to one meter or taller. The leaves\nare pinnantely compound, mostly with five to seven\nlanceolate segments, with harsh and scurfy surfaces\n(Bruggen 1976). The disk flowers are usually gray at\nfirst becoming brown with age. When the disk heads\nare crushed, an odor of anise is emitted. Each flower\nhas its own stalk and five to eight yellow, drooping\npetals arranged in a cone shape.\nDistribution: Yellow coneflower ranges from Ontario\nand New York to Minnesota, South Dakota, and\nNebraska, south to Georgia, Arkansas and Oklahoma\n(Steyermark 1963). For current distribution, please\nconsult the Plant profile page for this species on the\nPLANTS Web site.\nAdaptation\nThis species occurs in prairies, thickets, and borders\nof woods. It is often found along roadsides and\nrailroad right-of-ways. Yellow coneflower grows\nbest on loam, clay, and sandy soil types that are from\nmedium moisture to dry. It prefers calcareous soils\nthat are neutral pH 6-7, but will grow in sunny\nlocations with well-drained soils, and is often found\nin wet mesic, mesic and dry mesic sites.\nDivision of Natural Areas and Preserves\nOhio Department of Natural Resources\nEstablishment\nPropagation by Seed: Ratibida pinnata seeds are best\nAlternative Names planted in the spring or fall.
