In California,\nPlant Symbol = APCA\nIndian hemp and milkweed are used somewhat\ninterchangeably for cordage. The Luise\u00f1o of\nContributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data southern California for their dance regalia used\nCenter Indian hemp; the golden eagle or other feathers are\ntied to netting for the dance skirt for men (Merriam\n1955). The wild hemp was also used by the\nChemeweve for snares for otter and rabbits (Ibid.)\nDogbane is very important to tribes in the Columbia\nPlateau in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho for\nbasketry. The Quinalt, Kalispel, Nez Perce, Spokane,\nUmatilla, Wasco, Wishram, Yakima, and Klikitat\nused dogbane for cordage and basketry.\nFamilies use the native twine to tie together the\nframes for their winter lodges. They used it to sew\ncattails and tules into sturdy mats to cover these\nframes and to serve as carpeting, furniture, beds, and\nutensils. Dip nets, set nets, and seines were made of\ndogbane. The nets were strong enough to hold the\ngiant sturgeon caught in the Columbia River.\nOf all the important uses for Indian hemp, the\nitatamat , or \"counting the days\" ball, was perhaps\nthe most significant for the people themselves.
