It was used extensively as a folk remedy\nMoench.\n(Kindscher 1992). Purple coneflower root was used\nPlant Symbol = ECPU by early settlers as an aid in nearly every kind of\nsickness.

Perhaps the most\nimportant finding so far is the discovery of immuno-\nstimulatory properties in Echinacea purpurea and E.\nangustifolia (Wagner and Proksch 1985, Wagner et\nal. 1985). Stimulation of the immune system appears\nto be strongly influenced by dose level. Recent\npharmacological studies indicate that a 10-mg/kg\ndaily dose of the polysaccharide over a ten-day\nperiod is effective as an immuno-stimulant.\nIncreases in the daily dosage beyond this level,\nhowever, resulted in \u201cmarkedly decreased\npharmacological activity\u201d (Wagner and Proksch\n1985, Wagner et al. 1985). Other research has shown\nthat the purple coneflower produces an anti-\ninflammatory effect and has therapeutic value in\nurology, gynecology, internal medicine, and\ndermatology (Wagner and Proksch 1985).\nOrnamental: The purple coneflower is often grown\nsimply for its ornamental value, especially for its\nFrom TAMU-BWG Digital Library - Vascular Plant Images showy flowers.
