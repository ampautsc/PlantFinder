    "description": "Palm family (Arecaceae). Saw palmetto is a low\nshrubby palm with a creeping, horizontal, simple or\nbranched stem. Long-lived, some of the larger palms are\ncenturies old (Abrahamson 1995). The leaves are fan-\nshaped, up to one meter across, and are divided into 18-30\nsegments (Radford et al. 1968; Hale 1898). They have\npetioles up to 1.5 m in length nearly always with sharp,\nrigid recurved teeth (Radford et al. 1968). Fertile ramets\nproduce between one and five inflorescences with small,\ncream-co",

When cutting it, I always\nleave stalks with one or two green fronds, as well as the\ncenter growing core of the plant, as the Johnsons\n[Choctaw] taught me to do, so that the plant will not die.\nThis can be done twice each year. Palmetto baskets are\nmade from the cortical layer of the stalks, not from the\nfronds.\u201d The Choctaw remove the rigid teeth from the\npetioles and split the stalks into five or six straws, peeled\nand trimmed them to the proper width, and dried them in\nthe sun. They might be then dyed black, red, or yellow.\nSifters, pack, heart, and elbow baskets all carry its leaves.\nThe Seminole pounded corn into a powder, sifted it\nthrough woven palmetto fibers, and then placed it in a\nkettle of boiling water to make a porridge called sofkee\n(Covington 1993).\nFigure 1.
