# Quick Start: Add Azure Deployment Secret

## What You Need to Do

You have an Azure deployment token that needs to be added as a GitHub Secret. Follow these steps:

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to GitHub Secrets

1. Open your browser and navigate to: `https://github.com/ampautsc/PlantFinder/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Or manually: Go to the repository ‚Üí Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**

### 2. Add the Secret

1. Click the **"New repository secret"** button (green button in the top right)

2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_YELLOW_MUSHROOM_03D98F710`
   - **Secret**: Paste your Azure deployment token (the long string provided to you)

3. Click **"Add secret"**

### 3. Verify

- The secret should now appear in your list of secrets
- The value will be hidden (shown as `***`)
- Your GitHub Actions workflows will now be able to deploy to Azure

## That's It!

Once the secret is added:
- Push any changes to the `main` branch
- GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to Azure
- Your app will be available at: `https://yellow-mushroom-03d98f710.azurestaticapps.net`
