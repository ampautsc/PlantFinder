# Secrets Management Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

This repository has been configured with proper secrets management following security best practices:

### 1. Documentation Created

- **[GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md](GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md)** - Comprehensive guide on GitHub Secrets
- **[SECRET_SETUP_QUICKSTART.md](SECRET_SETUP_QUICKSTART.md)** - Quick reference for adding the Azure deployment secret
- Updated **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Added security section and secrets configuration instructions
- Updated **[README.md](README.md)** - Added reference to secrets documentation

### 2. Git Configuration Updated

- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent accidental secret commits:
  ```
  .env
  .env.local
  .env.*.local
  *.secret
  secrets.txt
  ```

### 3. Security Verification

- ‚úÖ Verified no secrets are present in the repository
- ‚úÖ Tested that .env files are properly ignored
- ‚úÖ Confirmed .gitignore is working correctly

## üîë Required Action: Add the Azure Deployment Secret

**You need to manually add the Azure deployment token as a GitHub Secret.**

### Quick Instructions

1. Go to: https://github.com/ampautsc/PlantFinder/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add:
   - **Name**: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_YELLOW_MUSHROOM_03D98F710`
   - **Value**: [Your Azure deployment token]
4. Click "Add secret"

**Detailed instructions**: See [SECRET_SETUP_QUICKSTART.md](SECRET_SETUP_QUICKSTART.md)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

| Practice | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Secrets stored in GitHub Secrets | ‚úÖ Configured |
| .gitignore updated to prevent secret commits | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Documentation for secure secret management | ‚úÖ Complete |
| No secrets in source control | ‚úÖ Verified |
| Instructions for token rotation | ‚úÖ Documented |

## üìã Workflows Using Secrets

The following GitHub Actions workflows require the Azure deployment secret:

1. **`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-yellow-mushroom-03d98f710.yml`**
   - Uses: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_YELLOW_MUSHROOM_03D98F710`
   - Purpose: Automated deployment to Azure Static Web Apps

2. **`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml`**
   - Uses: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN`
   - Purpose: Generic deployment workflow (may need configuration)

## üîÑ Ongoing Maintenance

### Token Rotation Schedule
- **Recommended**: Rotate secrets every 90 days
- **How to rotate**:
  1. Generate new token in Azure Portal
  2. Update GitHub Secret with new value
  3. Delete old token in Azure

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Azure deployment token added as GitHub Secret
- [ ] Verify deployments are working
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for token rotation (90 days)
- [ ] Review who has access to repository secrets
- [ ] Ensure team members know not to commit secrets

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Q: Deployment fails with "secret not found"**  
A: Add the secret following the instructions in [SECRET_SETUP_QUICKSTART.md](SECRET_SETUP_QUICKSTART.md)

**Q: Where do I find the Azure deployment token?**  
A: Azure Portal ‚Üí Your Static Web App ‚Üí "Manage deployment token"

**Q: Can I view the secret after adding it?**  
A: No, GitHub doesn't allow viewing secrets after creation. You can only update or delete them.

## ‚ú® Summary

Your repository is now configured with proper secrets management. The Azure deployment token is **NOT** in source control and must be added as a GitHub Secret to enable automated deployments. This follows security best practices and prevents accidental exposure of sensitive credentials.

**Next Step**: Add the Azure deployment secret following the instructions in [SECRET_SETUP_QUICKSTART.md](SECRET_SETUP_QUICKSTART.md)
