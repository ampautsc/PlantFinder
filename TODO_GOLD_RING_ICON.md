# TODO: Gold Ring Icon Creation

## Issue

The current `Camp Monarch_LOGO B1_monarch_gold_ring.png` file has a NEW golden circle added around the existing logo, but the requirement was to color the EXISTING outer ring gold (not add a new element).

## Required Action

An image editor (like GIMP, Photoshop, or Photopea) is needed to properly create this icon:

1. **Open** `public/images/Camp Monarch_LOGO B1 square.png` in an image editor
2. **Locate** the existing outer ring/border that is part of the original logo design
3. **Change** only that ring's color to gold (approximately `#FFD700` or similar gold tone to match the theme)
4. **Save** the result, replacing `public/images/Camp Monarch_LOGO B1_monarch_gold_ring.png`

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** add any new visual elements (circles, rings, etc.)
- **DO** only modify the color of existing elements
- The logo already has "kind of an outer ring" according to the requirement
- That existing ring should be colored gold, not augmented with additional graphics

## Testing After Creation

After creating the new icon:

1. Test in the app by adding a plant to the garden
2. Verify the icon shows the gold ring version when a plant is in the garden
3. Ensure the gold ring is the existing ring colored gold, not a new element
4. Check file size is reasonable (<20KB for a 550x550 PNG icon)

## Alternative Approach

If the logo doesn't actually have a clear outer ring to color, clarify with the stakeholder:
- What exactly should be colored gold?
- Can they provide a mockup or example?
- Should we use a different base image?
