# State-Level Native Range Data Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of state-level native range data fetching from the iNaturalist API. This enhancement provides detailed, state-by-state information about where each plant is native in the United States.

## Problem Statement

The original iNaturalist integration provided only regional native range data (e.g., "North America"), which wasn't granular enough for users who need to know if a plant is native to their specific state.

## Solution

We enhanced the iNaturalist data fetching script to query the API for establishment means (native vs. introduced) on a per-state basis using iNaturalist's place-based queries.

### How It Works

1. **US State Place IDs**: The script maintains a mapping of all 50 US states to their iNaturalist place IDs
2. **State-by-State Queries**: For each plant taxon, the script queries all 50 states to check if the plant has observations
3. **Native Filtering**: When observations are found in a state, the script checks the `establishment_means` field to determine if the plant is marked as "native" for that state
4. **Data Storage**: The list of states where the plant is native is stored in the `nativeRange` array in the plant data

### API Endpoint Used

```
https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/observations/species_counts?taxon_id={taxon_id}&place_id={place_id}
```

This endpoint returns observation counts and includes establishment_means data when available.

### Example Response

```json
{
  "results": [{
    "taxon": {
      "establishment_means": {
        "id": 3753895,
        "establishment_means": "native",
        "place": {
          "id": 18,
          "name": "Texas",
          "display_name": "Texas, US"
        }
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Script: `fetch_inaturalist_data.py`

**Version**: 1.1.0

**Changes**:
1. Added `US_STATE_PLACE_IDS` dictionary mapping state names to place IDs
2. Added `fetch_state_native_range()` function to query all 50 states
3. Updated `transform_to_plantfinder_format()` to accept state-level data
4. Updated main processing loop to fetch state data for each plant
5. Added rate limiting (1 second between requests) to respect API limits

**Rate Limiting**: 
- Each plant requires 50 API calls (one per state)
- With 1-second delays, each plant takes ~50 seconds to process
- This is necessary to avoid overwhelming the iNaturalist API

### New Script: `update_existing_native_range.py`

This utility script updates existing plant data files with state-level native range information.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Update all files
python scripts/update_existing_native_range.py

# Update specific number of files
python scripts/update_existing_native_range.py --limit 5

# Update specific file
python scripts/update_existing_native_range.py --file inaturalist-47912.json
```

**Features**:
- Skips files that already have state-level data
- Skips non-native or introduced species
- Updates scraper version to 1.1.0
- Preserves all other plant data

## Data Format

### Before (v1.0.0)
```json
{
  "characteristics": {
    "nativeRange": ["North America"]
  }
}
```

### After (v1.1.0)
```json
{
  "characteristics": {
    "nativeRange": [
      "Alabama",
      "Connecticut",
      "Georgia",
      "Kentucky",
      "Maryland",
      "Michigan",
      "Minnesota",
      "Nebraska",
      "New York",
      "North Carolina",
      "Texas",
      "Utah",
      "Virginia"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

### Test Case 1: Asclepias tuberosa (butterfly milkweed)
- **Taxon ID**: 47912
- **States Found**: 13 (Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia)
- **Processing Time**: ~50 seconds
- **Result**: ✅ Success

### Test Case 2: Introduced Species
- **Example**: Lotus corniculatus (bird's-foot trefoil) in New York
- **Establishment Means**: "introduced"
- **Result**: ✅ Correctly excluded from native range

### Test Case 3: Non-US Native Species
- **Example**: Ficaria verna (lesser celandine)
- **Native To**: Europe and west Asia
- **Result**: ✅ No US states found in native range

## Limitations and Considerations

### Data Availability
- State-level establishment means data is only available when:
  1. The plant has observations in that state
  2. Community members have marked the establishment means
- Some native plants may not appear in all states where they are actually native if there are no observations

### API Limitations
- **Rate Limiting**: 1 request per second recommended
- **Data Completeness**: Depends on community contributions
- **Accuracy**: Establishment means are crowd-sourced and may not always be accurate

### Performance
- Processing time increases significantly (50x) compared to v1.0.0
- Each plant takes ~50 seconds to process (50 states × 1 second)
- Batch processing of 100 plants would take ~1.4 hours

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
1. **Caching**: Cache state-level queries to avoid re-fetching
2. **Parallel Requests**: Use concurrent requests (with care) to speed up processing
3. **Incremental Updates**: Only check states where observations are likely

### Medium Term
1. **USDA Integration**: Cross-reference with USDA PLANTS database for validation
2. **Regional Grouping**: Provide both state-level and regional views
3. **Confidence Scores**: Indicate confidence level of native status

### Long Term
1. **County-Level Data**: Extend to county-level native range
2. **Historical Range**: Include historical vs. current native range
3. **Subspecies Tracking**: Handle subspecies and varieties with different ranges

## Conclusion

The state-level native range implementation provides valuable, granular data about plant native ranges in the United States. While it significantly increases processing time, the detailed information is essential for users who need to select truly native plants for their specific location.

The implementation correctly filters for native vs. introduced species and provides accurate, community-verified data at the state level.
