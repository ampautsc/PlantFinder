# ⚠️ MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED TO COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT SETUP

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

**Your deployment token must be manually added to GitHub Secrets. No code or automation can do this for you due to GitHub security restrictions.**

**What to do:** Click this link and follow 5 simple steps: [ADD_SECRET_NOW.md](./ADD_SECRET_NOW.md)

## The Complete Picture

### What Happened Before
- **PR #5**: Added a file with the token in it (❌ Security risk - tokens shouldn't be in files)
- **PR #7**: Added documentation about how to add secrets (✅ Good, but didn't add the actual secret)
- **This PR**: Explains WHY you must add it manually and makes it as easy as possible

### What This PR Contains
✅ **[ADD_SECRET_NOW.md](./ADD_SECRET_NOW.md)** - 5-step quick guide (START HERE)
✅ **[SECRET_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./SECRET_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Detailed explanation
✅ **[DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](./DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)** - Complete deployment verification
✅ **Updated [README.md](./README.md)** - Prominent notice at the top
✅ **Updated [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Critical first step section

### What You Need To Do

**Option 1: Super Quick (2 minutes)**
1. Open: https://github.com/ampautsc/PlantFinder/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_YELLOW_MUSHROOM_03D98F710`
4. Value: Your Azure deployment token
5. Click "Add secret"
6. Done! ✅

**Option 2: Detailed Instructions**
Read [ADD_SECRET_NOW.md](./ADD_SECRET_NOW.md) for step-by-step guidance.

### Why Can't Code Do This?

GitHub Secrets are protected by design:
- ❌ Cannot be added via code commits
- ❌ Cannot be added via GitHub API (without special auth)
- ❌ Cannot be added via automation
- ✅ Can ONLY be added manually by repository admins through the web UI

This protects against:
- Secrets being accidentally committed to version control
- Malicious actors injecting secrets via API
- Secrets being exposed in pull requests

### What Happens After You Add The Secret?

1. ✅ Your workflow file is already configured
2. ✅ When you push to `main`, GitHub Actions will run
3. ✅ The workflow will use the secret to deploy to Azure
4. ✅ Your app will be live at: https://yellow-mushroom-03d98f710.azurestaticapps.net

### Verification

After adding the secret:
1. Go to https://github.com/ampautsc/PlantFinder/settings/secrets/actions
2. You should see: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_YELLOW_MUSHROOM_03D98F710`
3. The value will show as "••••" (hidden for security)
4. Push a commit and watch it deploy: https://github.com/ampautsc/PlantFinder/actions

### Still Confused?

**Q: Can you just add the secret for me?**
A: No, I physically cannot. GitHub's security model prevents this.

**Q: Why didn't previous PRs add it?**
A: Because GitHub Secrets can only be added manually through the web interface.

**Q: Is there any way to automate this?**
A: No. This is intentional. Secrets must be added manually for security.

**Q: What if I get an error?**
A: Check [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](./DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) for troubleshooting.
