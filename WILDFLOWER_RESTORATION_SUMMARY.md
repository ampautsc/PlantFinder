# Wildflower Restoration Summary

## Issue
User reported that Golden Alexander (Zizia aurea) and potentially other wildflowers were mistakenly deleted during previous "plant trimming" operations.

## Investigation
Analyzed two recent commits that removed plants:
1. Commit `30c1ffb0` - "Remove non-wildflower plants from database"
2. Commit `9c588b86` - "Remove 131 non-wildflower plants (trees, grasses, sedges, conifers)"

Total deleted files analyzed: 354 plant species

## Classification Methodology
Plants were classified as wildflowers based on:
- Known wildflower genera (extensive list of ~150+ genera)
- Plant characteristics (perennial, bloom color, bloom time)
- Exclusion of non-wildflower types (trees, conifers, grasses, sedges, rushes)

## Results

### Wildflowers Restored: 214 species
